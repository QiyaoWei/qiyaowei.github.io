Organized and went on AI TigerTrek with my close (and brilliant!) friends [Evan Dogariu](https://edogariu.github.io/), [Michael Tang](https://michaeltang.xyz/), and [Jiatong Yu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jiatongy/)! We visited and had Q&A's at OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Redwood Research, Stanford HAI, Nuro, and more!
