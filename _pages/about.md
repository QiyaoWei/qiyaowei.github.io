Hi üëã! I broadly work on problems related to evaluating language model capabilities, systems programming for machine learning, and AI for science. I co-lead the <a href="https://www.gpumode.com/news">GPU MODE leaderboard</a>, where we recently hosted two <a href="https://www.datamonsters.com/amd-developer-challenge-2025">$100k competitions with AMD</a> and a <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/gpu-mode-hackathon/">model optimization competition with Jane Street</a>.

I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a>. I spent the summer before at <a href="https://sakana.ai">Sakana AI</a>. I spent a year before that as a researcher at <a href="https://www.vant.ai/neo-1">VantAI</a> working on AI-based drug discovery. 

Before that, I graduated as the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">top student of the Princeton CS department</a>, where I was blessed with amazing mentors: Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, Dr. <a href="https://ofir.io">Ofir Press</a>, and Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. During that time, I was doing some blend of AI/ML research while interning at <a href="https://research.snap.com">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com">Apple Ô£ø</a>, and <a href="https://www.claryo.co">Claryo</a>. Before that, I used to make and sell PC games, one of which was mildly successful (~100k+ players). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mmfo44FxhA">[unfinished example]</a>

Feel free to reach out to talk about anything through my email at [x]@mit.edu where [x]=altzhang. It's not obvious from my research, but I spent most of my undergrad studying math + CS theory and love to chat about it! On that topic, check out my college roommate Evan's [math reading list](https://bigmanoncampus.notion.site/reading-9385f76e5a624d75bb1a0c3d773a65c8)!
Finally, I'm also very active in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgIbYl6C5no72a0NUAPcTA">GPU MODE</a> community.
